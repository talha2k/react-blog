## Usage

To create a new React app for posts and components, you can use the **create-react-app** command in the terminal. This command is a tool that sets up a new React project with a basic file structure and a development server.

&bull; First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.

&bull; Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your new app.

&bull; Run the command **create-react-app react-blog**, where "**react-blog**" is the name of your new app.

&bull; After the command finishes running, navigate into your new app's directory with the command **cd my-app**.

&bull; To start the development server, run the command **npm start**. This will start the server and open your app in a browser window.
You can now start building your posts and components in the src directory of your app. You can also install additional packages and libraries using npm to help with your development.

## Running the app

To run the app, run the following command

```bash
  npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.You may also see any lint errors in the console.


## Further Development
